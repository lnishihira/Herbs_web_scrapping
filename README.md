# Herbs_web_scrapping

Plant Medicine has been a continued and valued practice for indiginous peoples and communities of color all over the world. I beleive there are many 
things we can learn from herbs. This project focuses on the ability to save money as a consumer in the drug market. 
What herbs can be best used to supplement medication? With the over-the-counter and perscription drug market's uncontrolled price gouging there must be a way to usurp this. 

This prject uses web scraping to grab information systematially about herbs and their remedies into a data frame to be analyzed.
