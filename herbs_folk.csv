"How to Use: 
	Milkweed ","The contrast between these two descriptions of the iconic monarch butterfly in our American landscape makes clear how much has been lost. We notice the monarch and bees because they are iconic insects, But what do you think is happening to everything else?
A major cause is farming with Roundup, a herbicide that kills virtually all plants except crops that are genetically modified to survive it.

As a result, millions of acres of native plants, especially milkweed, an important source of nectar for many species, and vital for monarch butterfly larvae, have been wiped out. One study showed that Iowa has lost almost 60 percent of its milkweed, and another found 90 percent was gone. The agricultural landscape has been sterilized. You can help!

"How to Use: 
	Tea "," ,Chinese legend dates green tea back to 2737 BC. Green tea is currently being studied for its beneficial uses, and as a treatment for a number of different conditions and illnesses. Most of the western world drinks black tea while much of Asia, the Middle
      East and northern Africa drinks green tea. All teas come from the same
      plant, ,, the different coloring is due to different
      processing of the teas. ,The health benefits of green tea are mainly credited to the catechin polyphenols,
  particularly ,, or (EGCG). Plant
  polyphenols are powerful anti-oxidants and have numerous benefits that include
  inhibiting , and tumor formation, , and
  inhibiting the abnormal formation of , that can cause heart attacks
  and strokes. ,
  The anti-oxidants and other beneficial compounds in tea may also
  be linked to lower rates of , in those who drink 3 to 4 cups
  per day.  , ,The calm, steady energy that seems
  to flow from sipping tea may be traced to L-theanine, an amino acid component
  of tea that has been shown in numerous studies to help reduce levels of stress
  and , , Many studies indicate that green tea has positive effects in  metabolic syndrome
  and , The
  importance of caffeine was also highlighted in these studies, green tea catechins
  taken alone had no significant effects. This underscores
  again the importance of using the whole herb in its simplest form, drinking
  tea as part of a healthy weight loss plan is more likely to help you achieve
  your goals. Tea can be especially beneficial when you drink it in lieu of
  unhealthy diet sodas and high fructose fruit drinks, however
  to get the full health benefits of green tea you should be consuming
  on average a minimum of 3 cups a day., Green tea
  extracts containing 208 mg EGCG have been shown to have beneficial
  effects on body mass index (BMI),  ,, total antioxidant status
  (TAS), ,, and glucose concentrations in studies on obese but otherwise
  healthy individuals. The only worrying side effect noted in the studies was
  a drop in iron levels; many of the polyphenolics in green tea can function
  as iron chelators, which may prevent absorption of iron. Even with this caveat,
  supplementation with green tea extracts may be one of the safest and healthiest
  choices for those trying to lose weight., ","

Wild yam creams and progesterone creams are applied to thin areas of the skin.

 Stevia is a herbal sweetener that is good for you, stevia leaf adds no calories,

   stevioside, is at least one hundred times sweeter than sugar, the exact amount

   stevia extract, or powdered crystals. You can tell by the clear color of these
   extracts that a lot of processing has gone on, and it is a safe bet that nutrients
   and health benefits have been lost in the changes, along with stevia's natural
   green color.  The best stevia I ever tasted was from a plant I grew
   on the patio one summer. Using the whole, fresh or dried leaf gives the best
   flavor to herbal teas, the taste is milder, sweeter, and the whole herb retains
   the complete range of medicinal properties. The downside is that use of the
   whole leaves is pretty much limited to flavoring teas, you can't use whole
   stevia leaves in baking for instance, or carry a handy bottle with you for
   work or travel., Stevia can work as a complete sugar replacement, but you need to have dried
   leaves, crystals, and liquid extracts on hand, and in a perfect world a few
